# FFT_spKE
Fast fourier transform (FFT) for kinetic energy spectrum, with fully openmp.

The method is to use 1D FFT to do 3D FFT. Simple math relation is derived.

The advantage is that it can easily achieve parallel performance

Kinetic energy spectrum is easy to deal with when you consider the power spectrum theory. 

The code is used to for a paper that is submitted to JFM.
